# Movie-TVApp
An app that shows you tv and movies.

This is a react app that shows, movies and television shows. I designed it and used Swiper JS to navigate the page. I learned quite alot about how 
to navigate through React. In order for is to work on github pages you need to use HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter. All in all I did quite a 
bit of research to learn how things work. I got more in depth with useContext and the syntax. This was also my first time implementing React Router
